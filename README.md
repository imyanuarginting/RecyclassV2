# Recyclass: Recycle Classification

"your guide to recycling right"

## Background

Handling plastic waste in Indonesia has become a major focus in the effort to maintain
a sustainable environment. Although there have been measures to address this issue,
the challenges remain great. The lack of public literacy in recognizing the types of
plastic waste is one of the main obstacles, which causes most plastic waste to end up
in uncontrolled landfills. Data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK)
through the National Waste Management Information System (SIPSN) shows that
plastic waste has remained stagnant at around 16-18% in the last five years. This shows
that the plastic waste problem has not decreased significantly. In addition, low public
awareness about the negative impacts of single-use plastics is also a serious problem.
Dependence on single-use plastics, such as plastic bags, cups, and beverage bottles is
still high in Indonesia. To overcome this problem, efforts have been made to implement
image classification technology using a transfer learning model. In this context, the
application development method uses the Waterfall approach. Transfer learning
utilizes the MobileNet model that has been pre-trained on a dataset of plastic waste
types resulting in an accuracy of 98% for training data and 98% for validation data.
This technology is expected to help in recognizing and classifying plastic waste types,
as well as supporting a better waste management system, including in sorting,
recycling, and processing plastic waste. Thus, this effort can be an important step in
reducing the negative impact of plastic waste on the environment in Indonesia.
